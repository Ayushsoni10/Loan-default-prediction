# Loan-default-prediction

Loan Default Prediction Project
Objective: Build a machine learning model to predict whether a customer is likely to default on a loan, based on their loan and personal information.

Data: The project will use a dataset of historical loan data, including information such as loan amount, interest rate, term, credit score, income, and employment status.

Methodology: The project will follow a typical machine learning workflow:

Data preprocessing: The data will be cleaned and prepared for modeling. This may involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Feature engineering: New features may be created from the existing data to improve the model's performance.
Model selection and training: Different machine learning models will be trained and evaluated on the data. The model with the best performance will be selected for deployment.
Model evaluation: The selected model will be evaluated on a held-out test set to assess its generalizability.
Evaluation metrics: The model will be evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions.
AUC: The area under the ROC curve, which measures the model's ability to distinguish between defaulters and non-defaulters.
F1 score: A harmonic mean of precision and recall, which balances the model's ability to identify defaulters and non-defaulters.
Business impact: The model can be used by banks and other financial institutions to make more informed decisions about loan issuance and pricing. By identifying borrowers with a high risk of default, lenders can reduce their risk and protect their bottom line.

Timeline: The project is expected to take 6-8 weeks to complete.

Resources: The project will require the following resources:

A dataset of historical loan data
A machine learning platform such as Python or R
Access to computing resources such as a laptop or cloud-based platform
Deliverables: The project deliverables will include:

A cleaned and preprocessed dataset
A trained machine learning model
A report documenting the project methodology and results
This project has the potential to make a significant impact on the financial industry by helping lenders reduce their risk and improve their profitability.
